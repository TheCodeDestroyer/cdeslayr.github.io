title: STUDENTS ORGANISATION KRANJ
job: President of High school council -
duration: May 2017 - present
description: Leading a team of 4 highschool students full of creative ideas, I got a chance to sharpen my communication, motivation and feedback skills. Having organised projects such as concerts, highschool trips and workshops, some of which were successful and others I learned from, I got to put my ideas to practice and organize events in their fullness- from project planning and strong, unconventional promotion to event execution and project reports.
